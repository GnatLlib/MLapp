# MLapp

A simple user-friendly demonstration of machine learning classification built using sci-kit learn and tkinter

Requirements:
python 3
sci-kit learn
numpy
matplotlib

Instructions:
The built in form takes in numerical data seperated by spaces.
The app currently only supports data sets with two features
After data is entered in the built in form the enter button submits the values

The Open File page can be used to read in a test file
The file should be in the same nummerical format seperated by spaces, with one line for feature 1, one for feature 2 and 
the last line for the classification

The user can then select to use either a Perceptron(PPN), Logarithmic Regression (LR), or Support Vector Machine(SVM) analysis,
or any combination of the three.

The Analyze button on the Results Page will generate a plot depicting the decision regions of each classifier.

SOON TO COME:

More analysis of each classification

Support for excel files

Support for higher dimensional data
